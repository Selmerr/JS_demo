            What is a promise,
                As I understand a promise is a way to say "IF this is resolved, THEN do this with the results". Not sure if 
                its a function or an object. I definitely need to read up on it.

            What does the fetch method return
                It returns a promise

            Why do we need to have two .then callbacks with our fetch code?
                Because the first then callback deals with if we were successful in fetching the data, and the second one deals with extracting and using that data.

            What can and should you do in the first?
                Put it in a try-catch to make sure we get a 200 response.

            What can and should you do in the last?
                Not sure. Maybe further error handling so we are sure the data we get is what we expected
