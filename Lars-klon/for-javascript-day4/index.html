      <p>Explain the concept async await, why it's almost always is preferred as the way to handle promises and how/where you have used it in your code and how you could access error responses from the backend

        So im generally pretty confused by async await. But I think it is a way to make asynchronous functions in javascript, that simulates code being run in sequence, even though it's smokes and mirrors. I think its prefered because it makes code easier to understand, since sequential logic is easier to understand. I think it made it possible for me to easier access the car object in the findCar function, but im not sure. With handling error responses we get them through in the response to our fetch, and with async await we can then catch that error, I think.
